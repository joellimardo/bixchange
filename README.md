This project started as a simple framework to convert command line scripts to web-enabled-CGI-based ones but kept finding different uses. Nowadays it is used for small teams of developers working on laboratory information management systems to model functionality, develop utilities for maintenance of systems, communciate with one another, etc. In short, it seems to have taken on a life of its own.
