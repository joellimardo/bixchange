BIXCHANGE INSTALLATION GUIDE
============================

Welcome and thank you for considering the BixChange Web Utility. This installation guide includes instructions for installing BixChange.

UNPACKING BIXCHANGE
-------------------

BixChange typically comes in gunzip format. Winzip can unpack such a file on Windows, but on Linux you will have to do the following to extract the file:

1. Place the bixchange.tar.gz file wherever you want the file extracted.
2. Type the following at the command line:

    gunzip --decompress bixchange.tar.gz
    tar -xf bixchange.tar

    or 

    tar -zxvf ./bixchange.tar.gz


THINGS TO DO FIRST:
------------------

   Note: BixChange development no longer occurs on Windows. You should get a Linux environment running to use BixChange. It *might* work on Windows though so you are welcome to try.

A. Disclaimer: Before proceeding you must read the license.txt file included with this distribution. It includes a disclaimer that states, basically, that we are not responsible for any damages caused by the installation. 

B. Install HTML::Template and CGI

   This kit ships with a legacy version of HTML::Template but not CGI.
 
   You can get the latest version on Windows (with the ActiveState Perl build) by using PPM.  

   For Strawberry Perl or something similar read documentation but it should probably by cpan or cpanm. If you are on Linux you can use the CPAN shell or just go to http://www.cpan.org, find the source, and copy it down to your machine.

C. Shebang Line: BixChange development used to happen on Windows machines and as such may have the shebang line setup incorrectly for your platform. Prior to installation open the bixchange.cgi file with your favorite editor and check the first line of the file (it will look like #!/c:... or #!/usr/local). Change this to the correct location of perl on your machine.

D. Cwd: On at least one installation the standard getcwd() function of the Cwd library caused a fatal error in BixChange. In this case you may be able to change the getcwd() function with the cwd() function. Try running bixchange on the command line once it has been unpacked with: perl -T bixchange.cgi. If you see a bunch of HTML then you are fine. If not, open bixchange.cgi with an editor and change the BEGIN block to look like the following:
 
use Cwd qw/getcwd cwd/;
my $local_dir = cwd();
...#leave the rest alone

Save the file and try the command line instruction again. If that doesn't work, send us an e-mail at support@forwardphase.com (do not include anything like passwords or proprietary information in your e-mail).

E: cgi-bin:  If you are using a shared server you may have to abide by your server administrator's policies regarding the placement of cgi scripts. Typically this is in cgi-bin directory underneath a folder that has been designated for public html files. Check with your server administrator for more information.

F. Chmod: If you are installing on Linux you should run through your installation and chmod everything with appropriate file permissions. 

     Something like this works on Linux/Apache installations:

     cd /opt/cgi-bin/  (or wherever you had to put bixchange)
     chmod -R 644 ./bixchange
     chgrp -R www-data ./bixchange
     chown -R <your user name on the system> ./bixchange
     chmod -R g+w ./bixchange/log

G. Modify /lib/BixConfig

Some individuals have asked to have the configuration moved to YAML and it may in the future. In the meantime configuration for the system is based on the contentsof BixConfig.pm in the /lib directory. Edit that file directly. Pay special attention to the WHEREAMI and WHEREAMIREALLY locations. Change the UNIVERSALSALT to something unique.  


GETTING STARTED
---------------

You know that BixChange is working when you can open a browser, point it at your installation, and call http://yourserver.com/cgi-bin/bixchange/bixchange.cgi. If you try this and get an error message you either a) missed a step from above or b) you have a problem we have not anticipated. In the latter case feel free to send us an e-mail. We will, of course, require the following information:

 a) The operating system you are installing Bx on (Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOs, etc.)
 b) Have you run perl -T bixchange.cgi from the command line? Send us the output if it is not the standard HTML that comes out.
 c) What happens when you try to call bixchange.cgi from the browser?

TAKING THE NEXT STEP
--------------------

Read the tutorials at bixchange.com (see http://www.bixchange.com) for more details). Every installation of BixChange comes with a 'Dev Guide.' You can find the link to it at the top right hand of the home screen. 
   If you are a developer, however, read the entire thing. Then start working with the system and looking at the coded tests (one of the other links at the top right of the home screen). The code for those tests is in the bixchange/data/m/ma folder. 

MISC. INSTALL ADDENDUM
-----------------------

If you are on Ubuntu Linux and planning to use Postgres you might find the following handy:

 apt-get install libdbd-pg-perl
