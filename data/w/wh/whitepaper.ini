GOAL=<<EOGOAL
BixChange is a software tool that facilitates the creation of web interfaces, a major component of web based applications. At present, many web applications have no centralized architecture. It is difficult to identify their necessary resources because the applications themselves are distributed across multiple machines, many in the form of scripts or smaller utilities which together make up a web application. BixChange aims to reduce this complexity by implementing a universal front end, or interface, for these applications.  

EOGOAL

INTRODUCTION=<<EOINTRO
BixChange is an ideal tool for web-based web applications because it provides them with structure that is separate from the technology itself. For instance, a BixChange front-end can be used for C#, Visual Basic, C++, Korn Shell, and other types of code on the back end.  BixChange universalizes the web interface such that changes in the underlying architecture are completely transparent to the end user. This means that some C# business logic utilized today can be supplanted with more robust C++ code tomorrow, for instance. 

In BixChange, all resources can share a common set of tools that generate interfaces, handle file locking, control users, etc. Content and data are considered to be distinct in BixChange. Changes to one should not always necessitate a change in the other, so you can change your data (or the code that generates that data) without touching the layout of your pages. BixChange's ability to use templates that can even be designed by third party developers allows the BixChange developer to concern him/herself with content and web architecture instead of layout.

<h3>Formerly CGI-only</h3>

BixChange used to be purely a tool to consolidate CGI scripts. This has changed with the adoption of mod_perl for BixChange version 1.8b. As such, BixChange can now be run either as a stand-alone CGI script or under Apache's mod_perl.


EOINTRO

PROJECT_DESCRIPTION=<<EOF
The BixChange project is dedicated to producing high quality web application development software that works across various platforms. BixChange is currently designed to work on either Windows or Linux Apache implementations as a CGI application. It was written in Practical Extraction and Reporting Language (Perl) version 5.6+ and requires an elementary knowledge of Perl in order to develop filters and sorts.
<P>
BixChange's basic file format is easily modifiable. Anyone, in just a few minutes, can master the basics of creating a resource file for use in BixChange. Filters and sorts, two other items defined in resource files, are also uniquely named and easily created. Resource files in BixChange can load virtually any other kind of object (any object accessible to Perl that is) for processing and content generation. A combination of filters, accessor objects, and templates is all that is normally required to create a comprehensive web application front end with BixChange. BixChange does not embed logic other than a few if/unless/include statements in templates so the separation of code and interface is comprehensive.

<h3>How is BixChange better than standard .HTML pages?</h3>

Although standard HTML pages will render very quickly in today's web servers, they lack the ability to present data from other data sources like databases. BixChange can read data from databases or from its own resource files to present to the outside world.

<h3>How is BixChange better than separate scripts?</h3>

You can continue to use separate scripts, utilities, and databases. The BixChange system, resource files, and folder structure enforces uniqueness and organizes their access into a series of URL calls that can be redirected (using version 1.8b's dbmlinks) without notifying the user. BixChange abstracts the communication layer between your scripts and the outside world that may want to use them via the HTTP protocol.

EOF
CONCLUSION=<<EOC
 BixChange offers a framework for web based development that separates content and logic from web templates as much as possible, giving the developer the freedom to change items quickly. Using BixChange as an interface tool will allow scripts written for very different purposes to integrate seamlessly.
